# SteamVR Trackers in Unity
A starter kit for SteamVR in Unity with VIVE Tracker (2018)

# Future work
This codebase has been superseeded by https://github.com/PTrottier/SteamVR_Tracker_Unity_Minimal because it reduces the frequency of releases required to maintain. It is possible for you to continue developing a package like this, simply start a new Unity project and follow the instructions at https://github.com/PTrottier/SteamVR_Tracker_Unity_Minimal, then add all added files to the package.
